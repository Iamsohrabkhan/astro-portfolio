Static websites have several benefits over dynamic websites:

1. Speed: Static websites are faster to load because they don't require server-side processing or database queries. All the content is pre-built and ready to be served to the user, resulting in quicker page load times.

2. Security: Static websites are generally more secure because they don't rely on server-side scripting or database connections. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities and hacking attempts.

3. Cost: Static websites are often cheaper to host and maintain compared to dynamic websites. They don't require complex server setups or ongoing database management, which can save on hosting costs.

4. Simplicity: Static websites are easier to develop and deploy since they don't require server-side programming or database integration. They can be built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making them more accessible to non-technical users.

5. Reliability: Static websites are less prone to errors and downtime since they don't rely on server-side processes or external dependencies. Once the website is built and deployed, it can be served to users without the need for constant updates or maintenance.

It's important to note that dynamic websites have their own advantages, such as the ability to handle user interactions, generate content on the fly, and provide personalized experiences. The choice between static and dynamic websites depends on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
